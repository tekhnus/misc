*This project was created during May-June 2014.*

*In order to launch the synth, first start a JACK server,
and then set up a MIDI source (a virtual midi keyboard, for example).*

Organetto is a progressive additive synthesizer.

It rocks!
---------

* Combine it with [hundreds of other JACK apps](http://jackaudio.org/applications/)
* Connect your shiny plastic MIDI keyboard or use a virtual one
* Written in good ol' C89, it will run on Unix, Windows and MacOS
* Extensible, modular and flexible architecture
* Use your favourite tuning. Equal? Yes. Pythagorean? Sure. [Wendy Carlos' alpha
scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_scale)? No problem.

Stay *tuned*!
-----------
Plans for development:

* More tunings!
* Accurate simulation of Hammond organ
* Leap Motion MIDI controller
