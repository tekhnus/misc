Twitterology: a set of tools for mining and analyzing data from Twitter.

I worked on it between December 2015 and June 2016.

The original was written in Python 2.
I applied 2to3 and worked out the obvious problems
with the dependencies, but it's hard to tell
whether this thing is working properly now
due to the lack of the documentation.
